  * OTA (Over the Air)
* Hosted by Microsoft
* Available in Visual Studio App Center
  * https://appcenter.ms/

## OTA (Over the Air) in React Native

* Update JS Bundle throught HTTP
  * Fixing bugs
  * Tweaking styles
  * Adding new features are also be possible
* No need to wait for reviews by App Store
* Native Modules can't be updated via CodePush

## Steps to setup CodePush

Just follow the document! Not so difficult
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/codepush/

1. CodePush-ify your app
2. Install the App Center CLI
3. Register your app to App Center
4. Release an update using `appcenter` command

};

export default codePush(codePushOptions)(AppComponent);
```
